Mining --> solving the puzzles to validate and add new block to the blockchain. 
Drawbacks :
1. Too Much energy cosumption. 
(BTC)
Whole country argentia -- BTC annual mining.
2. Networks Congestion --> 
Dynamic Gas price is on Gwei, if the networks is high then gas price is high.but if the networks is low, then gas price is low.
Dapps --> high on Congestion --> Txn more time to load blockchain.
At future, blockchain adoption will increase then new Congestion will also increase.
Founders are aware of this issue.

Setp 15 200, Eth Merge.
Consensus --> POW --> POS

Eth 2.0 Architecture.
1. Pos Consensus.
2. Shard States.

In order to join the etherum networks to become the validators, they need to stake 32ETH which will locks ETH for some time. 

Liquidity Pools. 
Stacking Pools.
As soon as 32ETH reaches, then etherum software will activate.

Steps :- 
1. Pos :- stake | lock => 32 ETH.
                       => ETH Software.
                       => Geth(Contains Public & Private Key.) -- Go Implementation of ETH.
2. 3 software needs to install on Pc.
    i. Execution Client.
    ii. Consensus Client.(Consensus --> voting and reaching agreement.)
    iii. Validator Client.
Above 3 software works together for proof of stake.

3. Adding a new blocks in POS.
 Slots and Epochs ko concepts hunxa yasma chai... 
 Eth 2.0 --> Beacon Chain --> represent --> POS based ETH blockchain.

Committee in POS : 
mining is not there in the proof of stake.

base rewards --> validator effective balance * 2*6/ Sqrt(Effective balance of all active validators)

In etherum --> Parallel Blockchain Exist.
